# JavaScript_Algorithms_and_Dataa_Structures_Projects
All algorithm and data structures projects from freecodecamp

Put my JavaScript skills to the test by completing these challenges necessary for the completion of the certificate. 
These chllenges test the skills I have gained so far during this course. 
I passed several test cases and had my work reviewed on these projects. They are as follows:

* Palindrome Checker
* Roman Numeral Converter
* Caesers Cipher
* Telephone Number Validator
* Cash Register
